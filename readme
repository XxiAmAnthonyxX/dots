*Notes*
Default Search Engine is disabled to prevent search engines from knowing your search queries. you will have to select what search engine to search with every time.
every time the SUPER+CRTL+C keybind is pressed the color.sh script will close and relaunch all gui programs to ensure theming is set correctly. all your history will be saved.
uncheck the 4 X'ed out icons in the ublock origin add-on dashboard when visiting any website to ensure full functionality. i value privacy/security but to not have to do this everytime uncheck these options in the ublock origin settings.
to make changes to any configs edit the /user.js /chrome/userChrome.css userContent.css /home/index.html style.css time.js files in /home/'USER'/.mozilla/firefox/'NUMBERS_LETTERS'.default-release/.
