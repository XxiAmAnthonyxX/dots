my dots are intended for a fresh minimal instalation of ArchLinux ; follow my guide HERE. the INSTALL scrips will auto configure nvidia to work with hyprland. if you dont have an nvidia gpu you are on your own. dont blindy run my scripts on your system as that can lead to potential conflicts. I have a guide to get gaming working with bottles HERE. the customizations below are manual steps that must be done before running 3_install.sh.
